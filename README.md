# Student Registraion Form based MySQL Database

Student Registration form in Java using MySQL Database.


## Acknowledgements

Creating a student registration form in Java using MySQL involves several steps. We have added three functionalities to our student registration database in this GUI. Firstly, we've added a button for adding data. Secondly, there is an edit button for modifying records. Lastly, we've included a button to delete records from the form. To establish a connection between XAMPP and the MySQL server for utilization in a Java application, begin by installing and launching XAMPP, which includes MySQL. Configure the necessary database settings, such as creating a database, user, and granting privileges. Then, in your Java code, employ JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) to establish a connection using the appropriate URL, username, and password to interact with the MySQL database hosted by XAMPP.
