A brief description of what this project does and who it's for @Student Registraion form.


## Acknowledgements

Creating a student registration form in Java using MySQL involves several steps, which include setting up the database, designing the user interface, and managing database interactions.. We have added three functionalities to our student registration database in this GUI. Firstly, we've added a button for adding data. Secondly, there is an edit button for modifying records. Lastly, we've included a button to delete records from the form.
